# Decentralized Web Demo

This is a decentralized web demo to provide an example of submitting compute from the web into [Lattice](https://computes.com/lattice) and returning the results back to the browser.

This demo uses the [sentiment analysis algorithm](https://github.com/computes/computes-sentiment). Any Computes algorithm can now be universally invoked from the CLI, localhost [REST API](https://github.com/computes/help/wiki/HTTP-API), and now a Web Browser.

Here's a quick video of this demo in action - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uex9u3lEeVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uex9u3lEeVM)

## Requirements

- [IPFS daemon](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/) running
- [Computes daemon](https://github.com/computes/help/wiki/Getting-Started) (Lattice) running
- This Node.JS app running (only required until JS-IPFS and Go-IPFS nodes can communicate P2P)
